\section{Splitting fields and Normal extensions}

\begin{prop} Let $K \leq L$ be fields. Suppose that $\alpha \in L$ is algebraic over $K$ and let $p(x) \in K[x]$ be a minimal polynomial for $\alpha$. Then there is a unique isomorphism $K[x]/(p(x)) \to K[\alpha] = K(\alpha)$ mapping $x$ to $\alpha$ and fixing $K$. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} There is a unique map $K[x] \to K[\alpha]$ mapping $x$ to $\alpha$ and fixing $K$. It is surjective and its kernel is the ideal generated by $p(x)$. \end{proof}

If $\sigma: K \to L$ is a homomorphism of fields and $f = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n \in F[x]$, then we let $f^{\sigma} = \sigma(a_0) + \sigma(a_1) x + \cdots + \sigma(a_n)x^n \in F[x]$.

\begin{lemma} Suppose that $\sigma: K \to L$ is an isomorphism of fields and suppose $K' = K[\alpha]$ is an extension of $K$ where $f \in F[x]$ the minimal polynomial of $\alpha \in K'$. Let $\sigma:K \to L$ be a field homomorphism.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\sigma': K' \to L$ extends $\sigma$, then $f^{\sigma}(\sigma(\alpha')) = 0$
	\item If $\beta \in L$ satisfies that $f^{\sigma}(\beta) = 0$, then there is precisely one extension of $\sigma$ mapping $\alpha$ to $\beta$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The first point is obvious. For the second point, let $\phi:K[x] \to L$ be given by $\phi(P) = P^{\sigma}(\beta)$. This is a ring homomorphism. Now observe that $\phi(f) = f^{\sigma}(\beta) = 0$, thus $\phi$ vanishes on the ideal generated by $f$ and so there is a well defined field homomorpism $\phi:K[x]/(f) \to L$ mapping $x + (f)$ to $\beta$. Finally, we use the isomorphism $ K' \cong K[x]/(f)$ that maps $\alpha$ to $x$ and fixes $K$, giving the desired extension. The extension is clearly unique as $K' = K(\alpha)$.

\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop: extend morphism to K'} Let $K \leq K'$ be an algebraic field extension and suppose that $\sigma:K \to L$ is a field homomorphism where $L$ is algebraically closed. Then there exists an extension $\sigma':K' \to L$. Moreover, $\sigma'$ must be an isomorphism if $K'$ is algebraically closed and $L$ is algebraic over $\sigma(K)$.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Use Zorn's lemma to construct a maximal subfield $K'' \subset K$ such that $\sigma$ extends to $K''$. If $K'' \neq K'$ then choose $\alpha \in K' \setminus K''$. Now as $K'$ ia algebraic over $K$ we can let $f \in K[x]$ be a minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$. Now as $f^{\sigma}$ has a root in $L$ as $L$ is algebraically closed, we can use the previous lemma to extend $\sigma$ to $K''[\alpha]$, contradicting the maximality of $K''$. If $K'$ is algebriacally closed, then so is $\sigma'(K')$ since any element of $\sigma'(K')[x]$ is of the form $f^{\sigma'}$ for some $f \in K'[x]$ and so we can let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$, giving that $\sigma'(\alpha)$ is a root of $f^{\sigma'}$. Now $\sigma'(K') \geq \sigma(K)$ so if $L$ is algebraical over $\sigma(K)$, then $L$ is also algebraic over $\sigma'(K')$. So if $L$ is algebraically closed then $L = \sigma'(K')$, giving that $\sigma'$ is surjective and thus an isomorphism (all field isomorphisms are injective). \end{proof}

\begin{corol} The algebraic closure of a field $K$ is unique upto an isomorphism fixing $K$.

\end{corol}

\begin{mydef}[Splitting field] Let $K \leq L$ be fields and let $\mathcal{F} \subset K[x]$ be a family of polynomials. We say that $L$ is a splitting field for $\mathcal{F}$ over $F$ if each $f \in \mathcal{F}$ splits into linear factors in $L[x]$ and $L$ is the field generated by $K$ and the roots of all polynomials in $\mathcal{F}$.

\end{mydef}

\begin{prop} A splitting field is unique upto an isomorphism fixing $F$.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $L \geq K$ and $L' \geq K$ be two splitting fields for a family $\mathcal{F} \subset K[x]$. We note that $L'$ and $L$ are both algebraic over $K$ (as they are generated by roots). This means that we may use Proposition~\ref{prop: extend morphism to K'} to extend the identity map $K \to K$ to a field homomorphism $\sigma:L \to \widehat{L'}$ where $\widehat{L'} \geq L'$ is algebraically closed. However, note that $\sigma(L) \subset L'$ since $\sigma$ maps each root of some $f \in \mathcal{F}$ to a root of $f$ (as $\sigma$ fixes $K$). So $\sigma:L \to L'$ is a homomorphism. It remains to show that $\sigma$ is surjective. To see this, let $f \in \mathcal{F}$ and write $f(x) = \prod_i (x - \alpha_i)$ where $\alpha_i \in L$. Then $f = f^{\sigma} = \prod_i(x - \sigma(\alpha_i))$. This shows that any root in $L'$ of any $f \in \mathcal{F}$ is in the image of $\sigma$ (using the unique factorization property). Thus as $L'$ is generated by these roots, the surjectivity of $\sigma$ follows. \end{proof}

If $K_1$ and $K_2$ are two fields with a common subfield $K$, we say that a homomorphism $K_1 \to K_2$ is a $K$-homomorphism if it restricts to the identity on $K$.

\begin{thm} Let $L$ be an algebraic extension of a field $K$. Then the following are equivalent.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $L$ is a splitting field for some family of polynomials in $K[x]$.
	\item Any $K$-homomorphism $L \to \overline{L}$, where $\overline{L} \geq L$ is an algebriac closure, restricts to an automorphism of $L$
	\item Any irreducible polynomial in $K[x]$ that has a root in $L$ must decompose into linear factors in $L[x]$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\begin{proof} (i) $\implies$ (ii): If $L$ is a splitting field for some polynomials in $K[x]$ and $\sigma:L \to \overline{L}$ is a $K$-homomorphism, then as in the proof of the uniqueness of splitting fields above, we see that $\sigma$ maps into $L$. We also saw that it permutes the roots of a polynomial in $K[x]$ in $L$ and thus the image of $\sigma$ is $L$, thus $\sigma$ is surjective and hence an automorphism.

(ii) $\implies$ (iii): Suppose $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible and has a root $\alpha \in L$. Now if $\alpha' \in \overline{L}$ is another root of $f$, then since $f$ is irreducible we have an isomorphism $ K[\alpha] \to K[\alpha']$ mapping $\alpha$ to $\alpha'$, which we may extend to an $K$-homomorphism $\sigma:L \mapsto \overline{L}$ by a previous Lemma. By condition $(ii)$, we see that $\sigma$ maps $L$ to $L$ and thus $\alpha' = \sigma(\alpha) \in L$. Hence $L$ contains all the roots of $f$.

(iii) $\implies$ (ii): As $L$ is algebraic, every element $\alpha \in L$ is the root of some irreducible polynomial $f \in K[x]$. We thus let $\mathcal{F} \subset K[x]$ be those irreducible polynomials with at least one root in $L$, which split into linear factors by assumption. Thus $L$ is the splitting field of $\mathcal{F}$ over $K$.

\end{proof}

\begin{mydef} We say that an extension $K \leq L$ is normal if it is the splitting field of some family of polynomials.

\end{mydef}

\begin{eg} The extension $\bQ \leq \bQ[2^{1/3}]$ is not normal. To see this we use the characterization (iii) in the Theorem as follows: The polynomial $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible, has one root $2^{1/3}$ in our extension but not any other. Alternatively, we can use (ii) by noting that although there is $\bQ$-homomorphism $\bQ[2^{1/3}] \to \overline{\bQ}$ mapping $2^{1/3}$ to $2^{1/3} e^{2\pi i /3}$, it does not restrict to an automorphism of $\bQ[2^{1/3}]$.

\end{eg}

\begin{eg} Normal is not transitive. As an example, consider the field extensions $\bQ \leq \bQ[\sqrt{2}] \leq \bQ[2^{1/4}]$. The intermediate field extensions are normal (as they are of degree $2$) but the extension $\bQ \leq \bQ[2^{1/4}]$ is not.

\end{eg}

\begin{mydef} If $L \geq K$ is an algebraic extension, then we say that $L' \leq L \leq K$ is a normal closure of $L \geq K$ if $L' \geq K$ is a normal extension and any $L' \geq L'' \geq K$ such that $L'' \geq K$ is normal must satisfy $L'' = L'$. That is, the normal closure if a minimal normal extension.

\end{mydef}

\begin{prop} \label{prop: normal closure existence} Every algebraic extension $L \geq K$ has a normal closure. More precisely, let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all irreducible polynomials in $K[x]$ such that each element of $L \setminus K$ is the root of some $f \in \mathcal{F}$. Then the splitting field of $\mathcal{F}$ is the normal closure of $L \geq K$.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $\overline{L} \geq L$ be the algebraic closure of $L$. Define $\overline{L} \geq L' \geq L$ to be the splitting field for the family $\mathcal{F} \subset K[x]$ of minimal polynomials for elements of $L$. We claim that $L'$ is the normal closure. Thus suppose that $L \leq L'' \leq L'$ is such that $K \leq L''$ is normal. We must show that $L'' = L'$, and since $L'$ is generated by the roots of elements of $\mathcal{F}$, we must show that any root $\alpha \in L'$ of a polynomial $f \in \mathcal{F}$ is in $L''$. To see this, note that by definition $f$ is a minimal polynomial of some $\alpha' \in L$. There is a $K$-homomorphism $\sigma:K[\alpha'] \to \overline{L}$ mapping $\alpha'$ to $\alpha \in L$. As $L'' \geq L \geq K[\alpha']$, we may extend this $K$-homomorphism to $\sigma:L'' \to \overline{L}$. But by characterization (ii) of the normality of $K \leq L''$, we see that $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $L''$. This means that $\alpha = \sigma(\alpha') \in L''$ as $\alpha' \in L \subset L''$. Thus this shows that $L' \subset L''$, and so $L' = L''$ as required. \end{proof}

\begin{prop} If $K \leq L$ is an algebraic extension and $L \leq L_1, L_2 \leq \overline{L}$ are two normal extensions of $K$, then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is a normal extension of $K$. In particular, if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are both normal closures of $L \geq K$, then $L_1 = L_2$.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} This follows from characterization (iii): If $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible and has a root in $\alpha \in L_1 \cap L_2$, then $f$ decomposes to linear factors in $L_i[x]$ for $i=1,2$. By uniqueness of factorizations, this means that these linear factors are in $(L_1 \cap L_2)[x]$. \end{proof}

\begin{prop} A normal closure of an algebraic extension $L \geq K$ is unique upto an $L$-automorphism.

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} By the previous construction, we have one such normal closure given by $L[\mathcal{R}]$ where $$\mathcal{R} = \{ r \in \overline{L} ~|~ f(r) = 0 \text{ for some } f \in \mathcal{F} \}$$ where $\mathcal{F} \subset K[x]$ is the set of all irreducible polynomials such that each element of $L$ is the root of some $f \in \mathcal{F}$. We now let $L' \geq L$ be another field such that $L' \geq K$ is the normal closure of $L \geq K$. We now construct an isomorphism $L[\mathcal{R}] \to L'$ which fixes $L$. We extend the inclusion $L \to \overline{L'}$ to an $L$-homomorphism $\sigma:L[\mathcal{R}] \to \overline{L'}$. Note that $L'' = \sigma(L[\mathcal{R}]) = L[\sigma(\mathcal{R})]$ contains $L$ and is the splitting field of $\mathcal{F}$ in $\overline{L'}$ over $K$. Thus $L'$ and $L''$ are subfields of $\overline{L}$ that are normal extensions of $K$ and both contain $L$. Moreover, $L''$ is also a normal closure of $L \geq K$ as it follows the construction given in Proposition~\ref{prop: normal closure existence} (i.e., it is a splitting field of minimal polynomials over $K[x]$ of elements in $L$). By the previous proposition, it follows that $L' = L''$, thus $\sigma$ is an isomorphism. \end{proof}

\section{Seperable extensions}

\begin{lemma} An irreducible polynomial $f \in K[x]$ splits into distinct linear factors in some algebraic closure if and only if $f' = 0$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} By the product rule it follows that if $f(\alpha) = 0$ then $\alpha$ is a repeated root if and only if $f'(\alpha) = 0$. If $f$ is irreducible, has a repeated root $\alpha$ and $f' \neq 0$ then $(X-\alpha) | gcd(f, f') | f$, which contradicts the irreducibility of $f$. \end{proof}

As a consequence, if $char K = 0$ then an irreducible polynomial must split into distinct linear factors.

\begin{mydef} We say that $f \in K[x]$ is seperable if $f$ splits into distinct linear factors in some (hence any) algebraic closure of $K$.

\end{mydef}

\begin{thm} If $char K = p$ and $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible, then each root of $f$ has multiplicity $p^r$ where $r$ is minimal non-negative integer such that $f(x) = g(x^{p^r})$ for some $g \in K[x]$.

\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Write $g(x) = \sum_j c_j x^j$. Since $$g'(x) = \sum_{j} j c_j x^j$$ we observe that $g'(x)$ is not the zero polynomial as follows: If $g'(x) = 0$ then $c_j = 0$ whenever $j$ is not divisible by $p$. From this it follows that $g(x) = \sum_k c_{kp} x^{kp} = h(x^p)$. It now follows that $$f(x) = g(x^{p^r}) = h((x^{p^r})^p) =  h(x^{p^{r+1}}),$$ which contradicts the maximality of $r$. Thus $g'(x) \neq 0$. This means that $g(x) = \prod_i (x - \alpha_i)$ where $\alpha_i$ are distinct. Write $\alpha_i = \beta_i^{p^r}$, which exists in an algebraic closure. Note that the $\beta_i$ must also be distinct. Thus $$f(x) = \prod_i (x^{p^r} - \beta_i^{p^r}) = \prod_i (x- \beta_i)^{p^r},  $$ where the last equality follows from Freshman's dream in characteristic $p$. As the $\beta_i$ are distinct, the proof is complete. \end{proof}

\begin{mydef} If $K \leq L$ is an algebraic field extension then $\alpha \in L$ is called seperable over $K$ if the minimal polynomial is seperable (splits over linear factors in some, hence any, algebraic closure). We say that the extension $K \leq L$ is seperable if all elements of $L$ are separable over $K$.

\end{mydef}

Thus from above, in characteristic zero all algebraic extensions are seperable, as all irreducible polynomials are seperable.

\begin{eg} Consider the field $K = \bF_p(t)$. The polynomial $f(x) = x^p - t$ is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion in $\bF_p[t]$ as $t$ is prime in this UFD, and hence $f(x)$ is irreducible also over its field of fractions $K$ by Gauss's Lemma. Now, $f(\alpha) = 0$ in for some $\alpha \in \overline{K}$, that is $\alpha^p = t$. But by Freshman's dream we have that $$x^p - t = x^p - \alpha^p = (x-\alpha)^p,$$ thus $\alpha$ is a root of multiplicity $p$ for $f(x)$. Thus $f(x)$ is irreducible but not seperable. \end{eg}

\begin{mydef} If $K \leq L$ is an algebraic extension, then we let $$Hom_K(L, \overline{K})$$ denote the set of all $K$-homomorphisms $L \to \overline{K}$. We let $$|L:K|_s = |Hom_K(L, \overline{K})|$$ be the seperable degree of $K \leq L$, which does not depend on the choice of $\overline{K}$.

\end{mydef}

\begin{prop} If $K \leq L \leq M$ are algebraic extensions then there is a bijection $$Hom_K(L, \overline{K}) \times Hom_L(M, \overline{K}) \to Hom_K(M, \overline{K}).$$ In particular $$|M:K|_s = |L:K|_s |M:L|_s.$$

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} For each $\sigma \in Hom_K(L, \overline{K})$ we choose an arbitrary (there are many choices) $\phi(\sigma):\overline{K} \to \overline{K}$ automorphism that extends $\sigma$, where we have used Proposition???. Now we define a mapping $$Hom_K(L, \overline{K}) \times Hom_L(M, \overline{K}) \to Hom_K(M, \overline{K})$$ by $$(\sigma, \tau) \mapsto \phi(\sigma) \circ \tau.$$ Let us first check that it is well defined. If $k \in K$ then $$(\phi(\sigma) \circ \tau) (k) = \phi(\sigma) (\tau(k)) = \phi(\sigma) (k) = \sigma(k) = k,$$ so indeed $\phi(\sigma) \circ \tau$ is a $K$-homomorphism. To show injectivity, suppose that $$\phi(\sigma) \circ \tau = \phi(\sigma') \circ \tau'.$$ Then for any $\ell \in L$ we have that $$\phi(\sigma)(\tau(\ell)) = \phi(\sigma)(\ell) = \sigma(\ell)$$ and by the same arugment $\phi(\sigma')(\tau'(\ell)) = \sigma'(\ell)$. Thus $\sigma = \sigma'$. This means that $\phi(\sigma) = \phi(\sigma')$ and so by injectivity of field automorphisms, we must have that $\tau'(m) = \tau(m)$ for all $m \in M$. So $\tau = \tau'$. It now remains to show injectivity. Thus suppose that $\gamma \in Hom_K(M, \overline{K})$. Let $\sigma$ be the restriction of $\gamma$ to $L$ and observe that $\sigma \in Hom_K(L, \overline{K})$. Now let $$\tau = \phi(\sigma)^{-1} \circ \gamma:M \to \overline{K}.$$ If $\ell \in L$ then $$\tau(\ell) = \phi(\sigma)^{-1}(\gamma(\ell)) = \phi(\sigma)^{-1}(\sigma(\ell)) = \phi(\sigma)^{-1} \phi(\sigma)(\ell) = \ell,$$ thus indeed $\tau \in Hom_L(M, \overline{K})$. This shows that $\gamma = \phi(\sigma) \circ \tau$ is in the image of our map, thus our map is surjective. \end{proof}

\begin{prop} If $K \leq L$ is a finite extension then 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $K$ has characteristic zero then $|L:K| = |L:K|_s$
	\item If $K$ has characteristic $p$ then $|L:K| = p^r|L:K|_s$ for some integer $r \geq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} By finiteness of this extension $L$ can be obtained from $K$ by finitely many simple extensions, so we only need to prove this when $L = K(\alpha)$ is a simple extension and then use the previous proposition to give the general case by induction. If $Char K = 0$ then we know that $|L:K| = deg f = |L:K|_s$ where $f \in K[x]$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$, where we have used the fact that $f$ is seperable and there is a unique $K$-homomorphism mapping $\alpha$ to any given root of $f$. If $Char K = p$ then $|L:K| = deg f = p^r |L:K|_s$ where $r$ is maximal integer such that $f(x) = g(x^{p^r})$ for some polynomial $g(x) \in K[x]$, as seen in a previously proven result. Thus completing the proof. \end{proof}

\begin{thm} Let $K \geq L$ be a finite extension. The following are equivalent.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $K \geq L$ is seperable.
	\item $L = K(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in L$ that are separable over $K$
	\item $|L:K|_s = |L:K|$
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\begin{proof} (i) $\implies$ (ii) is trivial. (ii) $\implies$ (iii): Letting $K_i = K_{i-1}(a_i)$ we see that $a_i$ is separable over $K_{i-1} \geq K$and thus $|K_{i}:K_{i-1}| = deg(f_i) = |K_i:K_{i-1}|_s$ where $f_i$ is the minimal polynomial of $a_i$ over $K_{i-1}$. We are now done by the multiplicativity formula. (iii) $\implies$ (i): We only need to focus on $Char K = p >0$. If $a \in L$ is not seperable over $K$ then $$|K(a):K|_s < |K(a):K|$$, but then $$|L:K|_s = |L:K(a)|_s |K(a):L|_s < |L:K(a)||K(a):K| = |L:K|.$$ 

\end{proof}

\begin{corol} If $K \leq L \leq M$ are algebraic extensions then $K \leq M$ is seperable if and only if $K \leq L$ and $L \leq M$ are seperable.

\end{corol}

\begin{proof} First suppose $K \leq M$ is seperable. Then clearly $K \leq L$ is seperable. Now for $a \in M$ we have that the minimal polynomial $f(x) \in K[x]$ of $a$ over $K$ splits into linear factors. If $g(x) \in L[x]$ is the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $L$, then clearly $g(x) | f(x)$ as $f(x) \in L[x]$. Thus $g(x)$ also splits into linear factors.

Conversely, assume now that $K \leq L$ and $L \leq M$ are seperable. Fix $a \in M$. Then $|L(a):L| = |L(a):L|_s$ as $L \leq M$ is seperable. Now let $L' \leq L$ be the field generated by $K$ and the coefficients of the minimal polynomial $f(x) \in L[x]$ of $a$ over $L$. Thus $f(x) \in L'[x]$ which means that $a$ is seperable over $L'$ as well (as $f(x)$ splits into linear factors and $f(a) = 0$). Thus $|L'(a):L'|_s = |L(a):L|$. It now follows that $$|L'(a):K|_s = |L'(a):L'|_s |L':K|_s = |L'(a):L||L':K| = |L'(a):K|,$$ hence be the previous theorem we have that $L'(a)$ is seperable over $K$, and thus $a$ is seperable over $K$. \end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Primitive element theorem] If $K \leq L$ is a finite seperable extension, then $L = K(a)$ for some $a \in L$. \end{thm}

\begin{proof} If $L$ is finite, then this follows from the fact that the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic. Suppose thus that $K$ and $L$ are infinite. We may reduce to the case where $L = K(\alpha, \beta)$, as the general case then follows by induction (If $L = K(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ then $L = K'(a_1,a_2)$ where $K' = K(a_3, \ldots, a_n)$ and certainly $L$ is seperable over $K'$). For $c \in K$, we let $\gamma_c = \alpha + c \beta$. We will show that $L = K(\gamma_c)$ for infinitely many $c \in K$ as follows. If $L \neq K(\gamma_c)$ then definitely $\beta \notin K(\gamma_c)$. As $L$ is seperable over $K(\gamma_c)$, this means that the minimal polynomial of $\beta$ over $K(\gamma_c)$ has another root $\beta' \in \overline{K}$. Thus there exists a $K(\gamma_c)$-homomorphism $\sigma:L \to \overline{K}$ with $\sigma(\beta) = \beta' \neq \beta$. We thus get that $$\sigma(\alpha) + c \sigma(\beta) = \alpha + c \beta$$ and thus $$c = \frac{\sigma(\alpha) - \alpha}{\beta - \sigma(\beta)}.$$ But the right hand side has only finitely many choices (as there are only finitely many choices of $\sigma$) and so if we choose a $c$ not of this form (as $K$ is infinite) we see that $L = K(\gamma_c)$ as desired. \end{proof}

\section{Galois Extensions}

\begin{mydef} A field extension $K \leq L$ is called \textit{Galois} if it is normal and seperable. We also say $L$ is \textit{Galois} over $K$. We define $Gal(L/K) := Aut_K(L)$ to be the set of $K$-automorphisms $L \to L$.

\end{mydef}

\begin{prop} Suppose that $K \leq L$ is Galois and $K \leq E \leq L$ is an intermediate field. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Then $L$ is also Galois over $E$ and $Gal(L/E) \subset Gal(L/K)$.
	\item If $E$ is also Galois over $K$, then every $\sigma \in Gal(L/K)$ restricts to an automorphism $\sigma|_E \in Gal(E/K)$. Moreover, this restriction homomorphism is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} It is clear from the definition that $K \leq L$ normal (resp. seperable) implies that $E \leq L$ is normal (resp. seperable). Any $E$-automorphism fixes each element of $e$ and hence each element of $K \leq E$, thus the inclusion in (i). For (ii): We already know that as $E$ is normal over $K$ then any $K$-automorphism of $L$ must map $E$ into $E$ surjectively as $E$ is the splitting field of some polynomials over $K$ and thus any automorphism permutes these roots (which are the generators for $E$ over $K$). By Proposition??? any $K$-automorphism $\sigma:E \to E$ can be extended to some $K$-homomorphism $\overline{\sigma}:\overline{K} \to \overline{K}$. But $\overline{\sigma}$ must permute the roots of any polynomial in $K[x]$ and in particular those for which $L$ is the splitting field for, thus $\overline{\sigma}$ restricts to an automorphism of $L$. \end{proof}

\begin{prop} Let $L$ be a field and let $G$ be a subgroup of $Aut(L)$. Let $$K=L^G:= \{a \in L ~|~ ga = a \text{ for all } g \in G\}$$ be the fixed field of $G$. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $G$ is finite then $K \leq L$ is a finite Galois extension and $Gal(L/K) = G$ and $|L:K| = |G|$
	\item If $K \leq L$ is algebraic and $G$ is not necessarily finite, then $K \leq L$ is a Galois Extension with $G \leq Gal(L/K)$. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{prop}

\begin{proof} We first show that in  both case (i) or (ii), the orbit $Ga$ is finite for all $a \in L$. This is obvious in (i). In (ii), since $a$ is algebraic over $K$ then there is a non-zero polynomial $f \in K[x]$ such that $f(a) = 0$. But now $f(g(a)) = 0$ for all $g \in G$ as $g$ fixes $K$ and hence $f$. Thus the orbit $Ga$ is contained in the roots of $f$, which is a finite set. So now we just assume that $Ga$ is finite for all $a \in L$. Consider the polynomial $$f_a(x) = \prod_{\alpha \in Ga} (x - \alpha).$$ Note that $g$ permutes these linear factors, thus $f_a(x) \in L^G[x] = K[x]$. Thus $a$ is algebraic over $K$. Moreover, it now follows that $L$ is the splitting field of $\{f_a ~|~ a \in L\}$, thus $L$ is normal over $K$ and also seperable as these factors are distinct. Thus $K \leq L$ is indeed a Galois extension.  We now complete the proof of (i), thus assume from now that $G$ is finite. To show that $K \leq L$ is a finite extension, it will be enough to find a uniform bound on intermediate fields $K \leq L' \leq L$ such that $K \leq L'$ is a finite normal extension (because we know $K \leq L$ is algebraic and thus if it is infinite then we choose finitely many elements in $L$ such that the field they generate is arbitrarily large. The normal closure of this field is also finitely generated hence a finite extension). Now as such an $L'$ is finite, the primitive root theorem says that $L' = K(a)$ for some $a \in L$. But then we know that the minimal polynomial of $a$ is a divisor of $f_a(x) \in K[x]$ above, which is of degree at most $|G|$, thus $|L':K| \leq |G|$. It follows that $|L:K| \leq |G|$, so $L$ is indeed a finite extension. Now we use the primitive root theorem to write $L = K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in L$. Observe that if $g \alpha = \alpha$ then $g = Id_L = 1_G$, thus $|G| \leq |L:K|_s = |L:K|$. This completes the proof that $|L:K| = |G|$. \end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Fundamental theorem of Galois Theory] Suppose that $K \leq L$ is a Galois extension. Let $Fields(L/K)$ denote the set of intermediate fields $K \leq E \leq L$. For a group $G$ we let $SubGrps(G)$ denote the set of subgroups $H \leq G$. Define the maps $$\phi: SubGrps(Gal(L/K)) \to Fields(L/K)$$ that maps $$H \leq Gal(L/K)$$ to the fixed field $L^H$ and $$\psi:Fields(L/K) \to SubGrps(Gal(L/K)) $$ which maps an intermiediate field $K \leq E \leq L$ to the Galois group $Gal(L/E) = Aut_E(L)$. Then $$\phi \circ \psi = Id_{Fields(L/K)}.$$ Moreover, if the extension $K \leq L$ is finite, then $$\psi \circ \phi = Id_{SubGrps(Gal(L/E))}$$ and thus these maps bijective and inverses of each other. Moreover, if $K \leq L$ is finite then a subgroup $H \leq Gal(L/K)$ is normal if and only if $L^H$ is normal over $K$ (and thus $K \leq L^H$ is Galois).

\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Let $K \leq E \leq L$ be an intermediate field, then we know that $E \leq L$ is Galois. Now let $H = Gal(L/E)$ and $E' = L^H$. Clearly $E \leq E'$ (if $a \in E$ then $h(e) = e$ for all $h \in Gal(L/E)$ and so $e \in L^H = E'$). Now suppose for contradiction that $a \in E'$ but $a \notin E$. Hence as $L/E$ is seperable, the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $E$ has another root $b \neq a$ and thus there is a $h \in Aut_E(L) = H$ that maps $a$ to $b$. Thus $a \notin L^H = E'$, a contradiction. This means that $E' = E$, thus showing that $\psi \circ \phi$ is the identity as claimed.

Now we assume that $K \leq L$ is finite, thus $L = K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in L$ by the primitive root theorem. Clearly $G = |Gal(L/K)|$ is finite since $g \in G$ is uniquely determined by the image of $\alpha$, which must be a root of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$. Choose a subgroup $H \leq Gal(L/K)$. Thus $H$ is finite and we may apply the Proposition~\ref{prop: fixed field galois group} to deduce that $\psi(\phi(H)) = Gal(L/L^H) = H$. Thus $\phi$ and $\psi$ are inverses in when $K \leq L$ is a finite extension.

Finally, suppose that $K \leq E \leq L$ is such that $E$ is a normal extension of $K$. We now wish to show that $H = Gal(L/E)$ is normal in $Gal(L/K)$. To see this, we know from Propoistion ??? that there is a surjective homomorphism $Gal(L/K) \to Gal(E/K)$ mapping $\sigma \in Gal(L/K)$ to $\sigma|E$. Observe that $g \in Gal(L/K)$ is in the kernel of this homomorphism if and only if $g|E = 1$ which happens if and only if $g(e) = e$ for all $e \in E$ which happens if and only if $g \in Gal(L/E) = H$. Thus $H$ is the kernel of a homomorphism, thus a normal subgroup as desired.

Conversely, suppose that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $Gal(L/K)$ and let $E = L^H$. We wish to show that $L^H$ is normal over $K$. Thus we wish to show that if $\sigma:L^H \to \overline{K}$ is a $K$-homomorphism then $\sigma(L^H) = L^H$. To show this, let $a \in L^H$ be arbitrary and let $b = \sigma(a)$. To show $b \in L^H$ we have to show that $hb = b$ for all $h \in H$. Now extend $\sigma$ to an automorphism $\sigma:L \to L$ (as $L$ is normal over $K$). Then $\sigma H = H \sigma$ as $H$ is normal in $Gal(L/K)$. Thus $h \sigma = \sigma h'$ for some $h' \in H$ and thus $$ h b = h \sigma a = \sigma h'a = \sigma a = b.$$ Thus $b \in L^H$. So $\sigma(L^H) \subset L^H$. It now remains to show the opposite inclusion. Thus suppose $a \in L^H$, then $\sigma^{-1}H = H \sigma^{-1}$  (note that $\sigma^{-1}:L \to L$ is defined as $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $L$). Now the same argument shows that $\sigma^{-1}(a) \in L^H$ and thus $\sigma^{-1}(L^H) \subset L^H$, i.e., $L^H \subset \sigma(L^H)$. \end{proof}

\begin{eg} Let $\alpha = 2^{1/4}$ and let $L = \bQ[\alpha, i]$ which is the splitting field of the polynomial $X^4 - 2$. Let as compute the Galois group $G=Gal(L/\bQ)$. Obseve that for $g \in G$ we have that $$g(\alpha) = \{\alpha, i \alpha, -\alpha, -i \alpha\}$$ and $$g(i) \in \{\pm i\}$$. Thus $|G| \leq 8$. Let us show that all $8$ combinations are possible (realised by some $g \in G$). Let $\sigma:L \to L$ be the complex conjugation map, so $\sigma \in G$. Now we know that for each $k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$ there exists a $g_k \in G$ such that $g(\alpha) = i^k \alpha$ (as $X^4-2$ is irreducible over $\bQ$ there is a $\bQ$-automorphism mapping any root to any other root). Now now that $g_k \circ \sigma(\alpha) = g_k(\alpha) = i^k \alpha$ and yet $g_k \circ \sigma (i) = g_k(-i) = -g_k(i)$. Thus the elements $g_k \circ \sigma^{e} \in Gal(L/K)$ are all distrinct for distinct $(k,e) \in \{0,1, \ldots, 3\} \times \{0,1\}$ and so all $8$ combinations are possible. Let $ r \in G$ be the map given by $g(\alpha) = i\alpha$ and $g(i)=i$. Thus $g(i^k \alpha) = i^{k+1}\alpha$. So $r$ rotates the elements $\alpha, i\alpha, i^2\alpha, i^3\alpha$ cylically. While $\sigma$ is an involution that swaps $i\alpha$ with $i^3\alpha$ and fixes $\alpha, i^2\alpha$. Every element of $G$ as of the form $r^k \sigma^e$ where $(k,e) \in \{0,1,2,3\} \times \{0,1\}$. Thus $G$ is isomorphic to $D_8$. If we consider the elements $\alpha, i\alpha, i^2\alpha, i^3\alpha$ as succesive corners of the square, then $r$ is a rotation and $\sigma$ is a reflection. Note that $|L:\bQ| = 8$ and a $\bQ$-basis is given by $$\{\alpha^k i ^e ~|~ i \in \{0,1,2,3\}, e \in \{0,1\} \}.$$ 

Let us consider some intermediate fields and corresponding subgroups. First, consider the reflection group $\{1, \sigma\}$. The only elements of $L$ fixed by this group are $L \cap \bR = \bQ[2^{1/4}]$. This subgroup is not normal and indeed $\bQ[2^{1/4}]$ is not a normal extension of $\bQ$. On the other hand, the rotation sugroup $\langle r \langle$ is normal, and so the fixed field should be normal, to compute the fixed field, note that we may write each $x \in L$ as $$x = \sum_{k,e} \lambda_k \alpha^k,$$ for some unique $\lambda_k \in \bQ[i]$. Thus if $rx=x$ then $\lambda_k = i^k \lambda_k$, thus we must have that $x = \lambda_0 \in \bQ[i]$. This shows that the fixed field for this rotation subgroup is $\bQ[i]$, which indeed is normal (the splitting field of $x^2+1$). \end{eg}
